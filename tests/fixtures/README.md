# Test Fixtures

This directory contains small configuration files and synthetic fixtures used by the
pytest suite.

## Files

- `minimal_config.toml`: Minimal TOML configuration for test jobs.
- `__init__.py`: Package marker for fixture imports.

## Notes

Fixtures are intentionally lightweight to avoid large binary test assets.
